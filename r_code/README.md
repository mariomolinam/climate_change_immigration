# R Code

The `R` code processes spatial objects,  manipulates weather data and combines it with survey information from the MMP (Mexican Migration Project) data.

The `00-master.R` file provides a roadmap for how the code should be run. The `functions_weather_data_for_ML_models.R` file specifies different functions that are used to create all the weather measures using the Dayment data. 

Importantly, the code assumes that the data has a specific format. If you try to reproduce the results on the paper, make sure you use the same names as those that appear on the code (e.g., column names).
